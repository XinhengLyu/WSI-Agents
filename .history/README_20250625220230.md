## 🏗️ System Overview

WSI-Agents employs a collaborative multi-agent approach to address the accuracy-versatility trade-off in WSI analysis. The system integrates specialized expert agents with comprehensive verification mechanisms to ensure clinical accuracy while maintaining multi-task capabilities.

The architecture consists of three core components: a task allocation module that assigns specialized expert agents, verification mechanisms that ensure accuracy through internal consistency and external knowledge validation, and a summary module that synthesizes final results with visual interpretation.
